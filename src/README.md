# Mandatory assignment 1 Operating Systems
This repository contains the mandatory assignment 1 for the course [IDATA2305 - Operating Systems with System Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IDATA2305#tab=omEmnet)at NTNU.  

## Assignment
Simple single and multithreaded web server. We chose to solve the assignment in rust.  

## How to run
You can either compile the code yourself or use the precompiled binaries in the [releases](https://github.com/JakobHolkestadMolnes/OSgroup6ma1/releases).  
In order to compile you will need cargo installed.  

In order to run, simply run the binary with arguments, `single` or `multi`.  
`$ ./osgroup6ma1 [single|multi]`
